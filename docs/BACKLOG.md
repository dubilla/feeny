# Feeny — Product Backlog

The non-design backlog: curriculum, adaptivity, and platform work. (Visual
identity work lives in `docs/DESIGN_BACKLOG.md`; the two proceed in
parallel.) Every item is a vertical slice — it ships only when a kid or
parent experiences something new.

**Content-slice ship ritual** (applies to every curriculum slice below):
author → `unitSeedSchema.parse` green → `pnpm seed` local → fixture decode +
full suite → curate/verify placement probes → Dan runs the prod seed →
`pnpm export:packs` against prod → commit bundled packs.

## Bugs (top priority — before new initiative work)

### [x] B1: Placement result doesn't move the kid's starting spot — FIXED (2026-07-11)

**Observed (Dan, 2026-07-11, real device):** Finish the Warm-Up Adventure —
the arrival screen says "Your adventure starts in <band>!" — but the skill
map still starts the kid at the very first unit of band 1. The celebrated
placement has no visible effect on the path.

**Expected:**
- The *current* (START) node after placement is the first unit of the band
  the arrival screen named — the screen and the map must never disagree.
- Every unit *below* the placement point is **unlocked but not completed**
  (believed-right design, confirm during fix): kids can wander back to
  easier material by choice, nothing shows a checkmark they didn't earn,
  and no "completed" XP/egg credit is granted retroactively.
- Mastery seeding below placement (`SkillMastery.seededByPlacement`,
  `assumedMasteryBelowPlacement`) keeps working as-is — this bug is about
  the path pointer/locks, not the mastery model.

**Fix shape (suspected):** `ProgressEngine.unitStates` derives states from
`placementBandNumber` + completions — audit why the current pointer lands at
band 1 (likely: "current = first not-completed unit" ignores the placement
band, or the map's scroll-to-current works but states don't). States are
derived at render time, so a pure engine fix should also retroactively heal
already-affected profiles — verify with an existing mis-placed profile, not
just a fresh one.

**Definition of Done:** Place into band N (N>1) → map opens with START on
band N's first unit, bands 1..N-1 tappable-but-unchecked; engine unit tests
cover placed-at-band-1, mid-band, and top-band cases; existing profiles
self-heal on next map open.

**Resolution (2026-07-11):** Root cause was *not* the engine — `unitStates`
already put START on the placement band. The map renders behind the placement
`fullScreenCover`, so its one-shot `scrollTo(current)` `onAppear` fired while
`placementBandNumber` still defaulted to 1, then never re-ran when the cover
dismissed — the map stayed parked at band 1 with START scrolled off below.
Fix: re-center on the freshly-derived START from the cover's `onDismiss`
(deliberate token, not the incidental XP re-render); re-arm the START pulse via
`onChange(of: state)` (its `onAppear` doesn't re-fire either). Design: below
placement renamed `.golden`→`.explore` — plain warm nodes, no crown, "Warm-up
practice — play any lesson for fun," and a played-through explore unit now
earns its checkmark (completion beats the band gate). Pure-derivation states
mean existing mis-placed profiles self-heal on next map open. Covered by new
`ProgressEngineTests` (band-1 / mid / top / finished-explore) + a post-placement
map screenshot in the UI journey. **Last mile:** confirm on a real device with
a band>1 placement (sim renders all emoji as "?" and the UI test's rotating-tap
placement lands nondeterministically, usually band 1).

## Initiative 1: Weave Fundations into the reading path

**Status (2026-07-13):** all six slices (F1–F6) built and **prod-shipped**.
F5 prod-seeded + packs exported on 2026-07-13 (reading → **v9** on the prod
channel, bundled alongside M1's math seed). Initiative complete pending only
the TestFlight archive (shared with M1). ✅

**Why now:** Feeny's reading bands teach generic phonics in a plausible
order. Most K–3 classrooms (including ours) run Wilson **Fundations®** — an
Orton-Gillingham program with a very specific spine: letter-keyword-sound
anchors → CVC with phoneme tapping → digraphs & bonus letters → glued
sounds → blends → syllable types, plus a parallel "trick words" track of
high-frequency irregulars. When the app's sequence matches the classroom's,
each reinforces the other; when it fights the classroom, parents notice.

**Guardrail (IP):** Fundations is Wilson Language Training's proprietary
program. We align to the *publicly documented scope & sequence* and to
general OG practice. We never copy Wilson materials — not their card art,
their exact keyword set, or their trade dress — and the name never appears
in kid-facing copy. Parent-facing copy says the honest generic thing:
"follows the phonics sequence used in most classrooms (Orton-Gillingham
style)."

### [x] F1: Re-sequence early reading onto the OG spine — SHIPPED to prod 2026-07-11 (reading v4)

**User Value**: A kid mid-way through Fundations K or 1 places into Feeny
and lands on the *same skill family they're doing at school this month* —
the app feels like it knows their classroom.

**Scope note (2026-07-11):** the misalignment reaches band 5, not band 3 —
today digraphs live in band 5 *after* sight words/sentences (band 4), which
inverts the Fundations Level 1 order. F1 re-sequences **bands 1–5**: the
big move is pulling digraphs/glued sounds down to ~bands 3–4 and pushing
sentence work up.

**Work**: Write `curriculum/FUNDATIONS_MAP.md` covering **all three
Fundations levels** (K ≈ bands 1–3, L1 ≈ bands 3–5, L2 ≈ bands 5–6; unit →
band/skill alignment, gaps called out) so F2–F6 and placement probes cite
one source; resolve the `read-sight-words` overlap in the map doc (band 4's
one-shot sight-words unit vs F4's recurring trick-words track — decide
whether it anchors the track or is absorbed by it); re-sequence/re-skill
bands 1–5 reading units to the spine (letter-sound anchors → CVC →
digraphs → glued sounds → blends → sentences/stories); fill the 2–3 worst
gap units; re-curate reading placement probes so probe order matches the
new spine; ship ritual.

**Definition of Done**: The band 1–5 reading path reads in Fundations order
end-to-end; placement lands a mid-K kid on letter-sounds/CVC, a mid-1 kid on
digraphs/glued sounds; map doc covers K–L2 and settles the sight-words/
trick-words question for every later slice to cite.

**Resolution (2026-07-11):** `curriculum/FUNDATIONS_MAP.md` written (K–L2 →
bands 1–6, decisions of record inside). Band 4 is now Team-Up Trail
(Digraph Dive ↓ from b5, new Sticky Sounds `read-u-glued` for *all/am/an*,
Sight Word Stars as the F4 trick-words anchor); band 5 is Story Stream
(new Blend Blast `read-u-blends`, Sentence Builders + Question Quest ↑ from
b4, Story Time); Word Detective → band 6 (skill `read-vocabulary`) for
pacing. All unit/lesson/exercise ids stable; skills moved bands with their
units. Band 4/5 placement probes re-curated (all single-tap, mid-unit).
**Engine fix (advisor-caught):** placement's assumed-mastery is now also
derived at read time (`ProgressEngine.effectiveMasteries`) so skills
moved/added below a kid's placement after a re-sequence don't read as
mastery-0 and drag Power-Up Practice back to band 1 — covered by new
engine tests. Full suite green; adversarial review findings fixed
(ambiguous 🍳-as-pan probe-adjacent exercise, duplicate drum fill-blank,
stale headers). Prod-shipped same day (reading v4, packs 0b91005).

### [x] F2: Letter-keyword-sound anchors — SHIPPED to prod 2026-07-11 (reading v5)

**User Value**: The core OG move — "a, apple, /ă/" — becomes playable:
every letter gets an anchor unit where the kid hears letter → keyword →
sound and picks/matches by ear, matching the daily card drill from class
(with our own keyword set, ready for owned art in design slice 13).

**Work**: Define Feeny's 26-keyword set (our words, kid-illustratable,
stimuli-emoji-fallback friendly); author anchor units across bands 1–2
using `listenAndPick`/`multipleChoiceImage` with spoken prompts that model
the three-part drill ("A says /ă/, like apple"); TTS-speakability pass per
AUTHORING.md rules (no bare phonemes TTS mangles — spell sounds in words);
ship ritual.

**Definition of Done**: All 26 letters have anchor coverage; every prompt
passes the spoken-prompt rules; a pre-reader can solve every anchor exercise
by ear alone.

**Resolution (2026-07-11):** Feeny's 26-keyword set is a decision of record
in `curriculum/FUNDATIONS_MAP.md` (ant→zebra, all short vowels, only
queen/zebra coincide with Wilson's; binding rules for 👑/🦎/🪺 ambiguity,
q/x/y format restriction, bare-leading-A/I TTS trap). Four new units open
bands 1–2: Letter Friends / More Letter Friends (b1, letter-name↔keyword,
upper/lower/mixed lessons) and Sound Friends / More Sound Friends (b2, the
three-part drill via word anchors, skill `read-letter-sounds` — existing
skills reused deliberately so anchor play feeds the same mastery the review
engine keys on). Anchor units placed first-in-band: START deliberately
pulls back to them for mid-band kids (pinned by engine test). Adversarial
review fixes applied: keyword emoji removed from unnamed distractor slots,
lesson-3 prompts no longer speak the answer letter, correct-position cycles
reshuffled, 3 letter-option exercises converted mCI→listenAndPick. Band-2
probes intentionally don't sample anchors yet (folded into F3's
re-curation, noted in map doc). Full suite green ×2. **Left:** Dan prod
seed + pack export.

### [x] F3: Digraphs, bonus letters, and glued sounds — SHIPPED to prod 2026-07-11 (reading v6)

**User Value**: The distinctive Level-1 material — wh/ch/sh/th/ck digraphs,
bonus letters (ff/ll/ss), and glued sounds (all/am/an, -ang/-ing/-ong/-ung,
-ank/-ink/-onk/-unk) — exists as its own named units on the path, not
smeared into generic "word families."

**Work**: Author digraph units (hear-it/find-it via `listenAndPick`,
build-it via `fillBlankWordBank`), bonus-letter and glued-sound units
(substitution-tested per the fill-blank rules); place them per the F1 map;
ship ritual.

**Definition of Done**: Each digraph and glued-sound family is a nameable
unit a parent can point at; all fill-blanks substitution-tested; band 2–3
placement probes updated.

**Resolution (2026-07-11):** Two units, not three (advisor call: ck and
ff/ll/ss are the same "extra letters spell one ending sound" move, so no
separate bonus-letters unit/skill). Band 4 path: Digraph Dive → **More
Sound Teams** (`read-u-digraphs2`, 4 lessons: wh → ck → floss ff/ll/ss →
mixed) → Sticky Sounds → **Sing and Honk** (`read-u-gluedng`, -ng/-nk
families + audible ear contrasts fan/fang, sang/sank) → Sight Word Stars —
exact Fundations L1 order. Binding rules added to FUNDATIONS_MAP.md: wh is
spelling-only (wine–whine merger makes it inaudible in TTS), no bare-w
chips, floss endings spoken as letters, no -an/-am chips in ng/nk banks.
Band-2 probe #1 now samples the F2 anchor units. Digraph Dive 3-01 copy
de-conflicted. Review fixes: 🗑️-as-"trash" ear task → word labels,
lesson-3 answer cycle broken, "kill"-formable chip swapped. Suite green; prod-shipped same day (reading v6).

### [x] F4: Trick words track — SHIPPED to prod 2026-07-12 (reading v8)

**User Value**: The words kids are drilled on weekly ("the", "of", "said" …)
show up in Feeny as a recurring track with spaced review — the app's
Power-Up Practice starts rehearsing exactly what school rehearses.

**Work**: First ~40 trick words sequenced per the F1 map as skills tagged
for review (`trick-words` skill family feeding the existing review-lesson
engine); recognition exercises by ear and by sight (`listenAndPick`,
`multipleChoiceImage` with word stimuli); ship ritual.

**Definition of Done**: Trick-word units live in bands 2–4; a kid who
misses trick words sees them resurface in Power-Up Practice within a
session or two.

**Resolution (2026-07-11, commit 186da5c; prod-seeded 2026-07-12, reading v8, packs 7d4b77e):** 40 words
(8 live in Sight Word Stars + 32 new), our own Dolch-derived sequencing
(IP guardrail). Four new units after each band's phonics: Star Word
Sprouts (b2, `read-sight-start`, recognition-only per new AUTHORING.md
band-2 printed-word carve-out), Star Words Grow + Star Word Pals (b3,
shared `read-sight-grow` — F3 precedent), Star Word Sky (b4, shared
`read-sight-words`). Zero engine work: weakest-skill review surfaces the
track in Power-Up Practice; per `effectiveMasteries`, kids placed at b4+
get resurfacing via the b4 units only (documented, accepted). Advisor
catches folded in (a/I → me/up TTS trap, to/two + one/won homophone
rules); adversarial review fixes applied (ordering double-solve,
band-2 audio/option leak, fill-blank near-double-solves). Probes
deliberately unchanged. Decisions of record in FUNDATIONS_MAP.md.

### [x] F5: Tap-the-sounds — SHIPPED to prod 2026-07-13 (reading v9)

**User Value**: Fundations' signature physical move — tapping out the
sounds in a word — becomes a Feeny exercise: TTS says "cat," the kid taps
once per sound, the word builds as they tap. The one piece of the daily
drill no current exercise type can express.

**Work**: New exercise type end-to-end under the **contract rule** (one
commit: zod schema + Swift mirror + `pnpm export:fixtures` +
`docs/CONTENT_SPEC.md`; old apps skip via `.unsupported`); kid-UX per
Theme rules (≥88pt tap targets, spoken-first, warm retry); author ≥6
segmentation lessons across bands 1–3; UI-test coverage in the rotating-tap
answer loop; ship ritual.

**Definition of Done**: A pre-reader can complete a segmentation lesson by
ear; fixtures decode on old + new app posture; the type appears in
placement probes only if single-tap-solvable (else excluded by rule).

**Resolution (2026-07-12, PR #1 merged to main):** Interaction is the
**Guided tap-out** (owner call over build-by-ear / count-the-sounds): TTS
speaks the whole word, kid taps a row of boxes L→R — each revealing its
grapheme + a soft pop — then the word blends. Kinesthetic practice, always
warm-correct. Contract: `tapTheSoundsPayloadSchema` (prompt spokenText
required, `word`, optional `visual`, `sounds: [{grapheme}]` 2–5) + refine
that graphemes concatenate to `word` (digraph = ONE tile: sh/ch/th/ck).
**No per-phoneme audio** — TTS mangles isolated sounds (AUTHORING ban), so
all speech stays at word level. Two guardrails beyond the raw contract:
(1) always-correct tap-outs are excluded from the `firstTryAccuracy`
denominator (`LessonSession.gradedCount`) so they can't inflate mastery/
band advancement; (2) `validateSubjectSeed` now enforces "tap-out lesson ⇒
≥2 graded exercises" and "placement probes must be single-tap." Content:
band-2 *Tap It Out* (clean CVC) + band-3 *Sound Tappers* (digraphs), 6
lessons. Reading content bumps to **v17** on the prod seed. Verified: unit
suite + full UI journey + 2 new accuracy-exclusion tests; view confirmed
on-sim (c→a→t builds). **Remaining (Dan): prod seed → `pnpm export:packs`
against prod → bundled-packs commit → TestFlight.**

### [x] F6: The decoding middle — silent-e, vowel teams, r-controlled, blends — SHIPPED to prod 2026-07-11 (reading v7)

**User Value**: A kid who finishes digraphs today jumps straight to
vocabulary-in-context — the actual learning-to-read middle is missing.
This slice gives the 6–8 year old mid-reader (Fundations L1 late → L2) a
real path: blends, silent-e/long vowels, vowel teams (ai/ee/oa…),
r-controlled vowels, and first multisyllable decoding.

**Work**: Author blend units (named in the F3 spine but no unit exists),
silent-e, vowel-team, and r-controlled units into bands 5–6 per the F1 map;
reframe band 6's "word parts" as syllable-aware decoding rather than only
prefixes/suffixes; update band 5–6 placement probes; ship ritual. No new
exercise types needed.

**Definition of Done**: A kid can travel band 5 → 6 through blends →
silent-e → vowel teams → r-controlled without a gap; each family is a
nameable unit; probes cover the new middle.

**Shipped as**: Super Blends (`read-u-blends2`, band 5) + Magic E /
Team Vowels / Bossy R (`read-u-silente`/`read-u-vowelteams`/
`read-u-rcontrolled`, three new band-6 skills) + Word Parts Workshop
reframed syllable-aware under stable ids. Band-6 probes resampled
(silent-e, vowel teams, context). Guardrails recorded in
FUNDATIONS_MAP.md "F6 decisions of record" (ow/ea one-sound rule,
er/ir/ur spelling-fact rule, cross-unit homophone bans). Adversarial
review pass applied (answer leak, double-solve banks, thread/ea
violation, emoji bindings). Prod-seeded same day (reading v7, packs 4c24bb4).

*Sequencing: F1 first (pure re-sequencing, highest leverage, no new
surface), F2–F4 in any order after it, F6 after F3 (biggest kid-value gap,
no new surface — arguably ahead of F4/F5), F5 last (only contract change —
riskiest).*

## Initiative 2: Second-grade add/sub strategies (math ↔ classroom)

**Why now:** The school's second-grade classroom teaches two-digit addition
and subtraction as a repertoire of named strategies (source: classroom
anchor charts, on file — "Addition and Subtraction Strategies.pdf" in
Dan's Downloads; standard CGI/Common Core strategy set, no IP concern
beyond not copying the chart art/wording). Feeny's band 5 currently asks
only for *answers* (Two-Digit Team-Up) and quietly avoids every regrouping
problem (32+15, 41+26 — never 27+16). When the app names the same moves
the classroom names, each reinforces the other — the Fundations lesson,
applied to math.

**The strategy set (source of record for this initiative):**

*Addition (canonical worked example 27 + 16 = 43):*
- **Counting On** — start with the larger addend, count on by ones or in
  chunks: 27 → +10 → 37 → +3 → 40 → +3 → 43.
- **Adding by Place Value** — decompose both addends (27 = 20+7,
  16 = 10+6), add tens (30), add ones (13), combine (43).
- **Compensation** — shift between addends to make "friendly" numbers
  (ending in 0): 27+16 → (+3/−3) → 30+13 = 43.
- **Diagram in sets of 10** — classroom treats as a fallback ("working
  away from drawing pictures"); NOT its own unit — appears only as
  "count tens first" framing inside place-value exercises.

*Subtraction (canonical worked example 32 − 15 = 17):*
- **Count Back** — number line back by ones or chunks:
  32 → −10 → 22 → −2 → 20 → −3 → 17.
- **Subtract in Parts** — keep the larger number whole, break up the
  smaller: 32 − 10 = 22, 22 − 5 = 17.
- **Add Up** — rewrite as missing addend: 15 + ___ = 32; jump
  15 → +10 → 25 → +5 → 30 → +2 → 32, so 10+5+2 = 17.
- **Diagram** — same fallback status as addition.

### [x] M1: Strategy units for band 5 (+ make-ten bridge in band 4) — SHIPPED to prod 2026-07-13 (math v4)

**User Value**: A second grader mid-way through two-digit add/sub hears
Feeny use the exact strategy language from class — "count on in chunks,"
"friendly numbers," "add up" — and finally gets regrouping problems
(27+16, 32−15), which the current band 5 unit avoids entirely.

**Work** (all expressible in the existing 6 exercise types — NO contract
change; F5 remains the only contract slice):

1. New band-4 bridge unit `math-u-maketen` "Make-Ten Machine" (skill
   `math-add-sub-20`): the make-a-ten move within 20 (9+7 → 10+6,
   8+5 → 10+3) — the precursor to compensation and chunking. Types:
   tapMatchPairs (9+7 ↔ 10+6), fillBlankWordBank ("9 + 7 = 10 + ___"),
   multipleChoiceImage.
2. Three new band-5 units (skill `math-add-sub-100`), path order after
   Hundred Chart Hike, before Two-Digit Team-Up (strategies first, then
   the existing mixed-practice unit becomes their payoff):
   - `math-u-jumps` "Jump-Along Trail" — Counting On + Count Back in
     chunks. `ordering` = number-line landmarks in visit order
     (27, 37, 40, 43); `fillBlankWordBank` = next-stop chains
     ("27 + 10 = ___", "37 + 3 = ___"); `listenAndPick` for by-ones
     counting. Lesson 3 mixes direction (on vs back).
   - `math-u-breakapart` "Break-Apart Builders" — Adding by Place Value +
     Subtract in Parts. `tapMatchPairs` (27 ↔ 20 + 7); fill-blank
     partial-step chains ("20 + 10 = ___", "30 + 13 = ___",
     "32 − 10 = ___ then ___ − 5 = 17"); "count tens first" diagram
     framing lives here (emoji ten-groups in multipleChoiceImage).
   - `math-u-friendly` "Friendly Number Fix-Up" — Compensation + Add Up.
     multipleChoiceImage "which problem is the same as 27 + 16?"
     (→ 30 + 13, distractors 30 + 16 / 24 + 13); missing-addend
     fill-blanks (15 + ___ = 32); tapMatchPairs problem ↔ friendly twin.
3. Regrouping unlocked: every unit's lesson 3 uses regrouping problems
   (sums crossing a ten, differences borrowing). Audit Two-Digit Team-Up
   afterward: add 2–3 regrouping exercises to its lesson 3 under NEW
   exercise ids (never edit existing ids' content semantics).
4. Curate band-4/5 placement probes: consider swapping one band-5 probe
   for a single-tap strategy exercise (mid-unit, per probe rules) —
   decide at execution, document either way.
5. Ship ritual (author → zod → local seed → suite → Dan prod seed →
   export:packs → commit).

**Authoring hazards (binding, F4-style):**
- Math must be correct at every STEP, not just the final answer — chains
  like 27+10=37 have per-exercise answers; check each twice.
- Distractors = real error patterns: forgot-the-carry (33 for 27+16),
  ten-slip (±10), compensation-both-ways (30+19 for 27+16). Never random.
- Spoken prompts: numbers read naturally ("twenty-seven plus ten"); never
  state the step's answer; one register (equation OR story, not both);
  strategy names spoken warmly ("Let's count on in chunks!").
- `ordering` landmark exercises must have exactly one correct order —
  landmark sets must be strictly monotonic (no ambiguity about direction).
- fillBlankWordBank: one blank, 3–4 numeric chips, no two chips that both
  satisfy the template.
- Band 5 kids read short words, but every prompt still carries the full
  task when spoken.

**Definition of Done**: A kid in band 5 meets all six named strategies
across three units with regrouping problems throughout; make-ten bridge
exists in band 4; each strategy's *method* is the thing exercised (steps,
equivalences, landmarks) — not just final answers; suite green; shipped.

**Resolution (2026-07-13, built):** All four units authored (fan-out, one
agent per unit) and wired in path order: band 4 `math-u-maketen` "Make-Ten
Machine" (make-a-ten within 20, precursor to compensation/chunking); band 5
`math-u-jumps` "Jump-Along Trail" (Counting On + Count Back in chunks),
`math-u-breakapart` "Break-Apart Builders" (Place Value + Subtract in Parts),
`math-u-friendly` "Friendly Number Fix-Up" (Compensation + Add Up) — inserted
`hundred → jumps → breakapart → friendly → 2digit`, so Two-Digit Team-Up
becomes the mixed-practice payoff. All six named classroom strategies covered.
Two-Digit Team-Up lesson 3 gained three regrouping exercises under NEW ids
(`-3-09/-10/-11`, existing untouched). Band-5 placement probe swapped
`math-e-2digit-2-03` (no-regroup) → `math-e-jumps-2-07` (45−17, regrouping,
single-tap) so the gate tests band-5-level regrouping. No contract change (all
6 existing types). Fable reviewer pass caught + fixed two `tapMatchPairs`
ambiguities (two problems sharing a sum) and a "friendly twin" that had no
friendly ten; math otherwise clean. Verified: full-seed `validateSubjectSeed`
+ automated tapMatchPairs-ambiguity check green; `xcodebuild test` green
(FeenyTests + PlayLessonUITests); reviewed on an artifact page (92 exercises).
Prod-seeded 2026-07-13 (math → **v4** on the prod channel; local counter was
v8) and bundled packs exported against prod alongside F5 (reading v9).
**Remaining (Dan): TestFlight archive** (shared with F5).
